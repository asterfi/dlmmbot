description: Every section and key in config.toml with its shipped default — hot-reloaded at runtime, edited via the dashboard Settings or data/config.toml.

# Configuration reference

Every knob the bot obeys lives in one TOML file. Key facts before the tables:

- **Runtime config lives under `data/`** (`data/config.toml`, or wherever `FARMER_CONFIG_PATH` points — `/app/data` on Railway). The repo's `config.toml` is only a **template** copied on first run. Edit the runtime copy (or use dashboard **Settings**), never the tracked file.
- **Hot-reload:** changes apply within seconds while the bot runs — no restart. A file that fails to parse is ignored and the previous config stays active.
- Dashboard **Settings → Bot settings** writes these same keys, and [Settings profiles](./profiles) apply curated packs of them.
- Defaults below are the shipped template values. Several were deliberately tightened from the original spec after live trading (noted where interesting).

<p class="note warn">Don’t casually weaken stops, brakes, or vetting gates — they exist because the alternatives lost money. Change with evidence. See <a href="./risk">Risk &amp; sizing</a>.</p>

## `[scanner]`

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `interval_s` | `60` | Seconds between scanner sweeps |
| `pages` | `3` | Meteora datapi pages per sweep (100 pools/page) |
| `datapi_concurrency` | `4` | Max datapi requests in flight. Sweep pages and majors whitelist lookups are independent round-trips that used to run one at a time, so a sweep paid the **sum** of their latency. Page 1 is still fetched alone — its page count sizes the rest |
| `copycat_ignore_h` | `24` | Losers of symbol dedupe ignored this long (hours) |
| `sibling_tvl_tie_pct` | `25` | Among a token's gate-passing pools, the **deepest** wins; fee/TVL breaks ties only within this % of the deepest pool's TVL. Replaces "highest fee/TVL", which structurally picked the thinnest sibling — thin pools earn less and their TVL swings 40–50% on ordinary LP moves, which P0 `tvl_drain` reads as a rug |
| `retain_skipped_days` | `30` | Prune `skipped` decision rows older than this (hourly). `entered`/`exited` rows — the audit trail — are **never** pruned. Nothing pruned these before; a Railway volume hit 83% inside a day. A rejection that repeats every sweep is stored as one row per 6-hour episode with a `sweeps` count, so 30 days now fits where a few hours used to |
| `retain_snapshots_days` | `3` | Prune `pool_snapshots` older than this. Only the latest row per pool is read; the rest was an offline replay dataset. Every ~300-row sweep lands here — at one sweep a minute, 3 days is ~1.3M rows (~245 MB), more than the default `db_max_mb` by itself. `1` keeps it near 80 MB |
| `db_max_mb` | `200` | Hard ceiling on `farmer.db`: above it, rows are trimmed oldest-first regardless of age — **snapshots first**, skip rows only once no snapshot is left to take, so the rejection history survives the ceiling. The hourly `VACUUM` briefly needs about the database's size again in free space, so keep this under **~40% of your volume** — on a 1 GB Railway volume, 400 MB peaked at 92% |

## `[eys]` — hosted hot-mint intake

When Eys is explicitly active, fresh GMGN `1m` rows at or above `flow_floor_usd` are
resolved into exact Meteora pools before Eys evaluation. This supplements the ranked
Datapi sweep; it does not alter core mode or bypass any safety/execution gate.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `false` | Enable the hosted Eys strategy when `strategy.mode = "eys"` |
| `market_cap_floor_usd` | `100000` | Eys market-cap floor |
| `flow_floor_usd` | `100000` | Genuine GMGN `1m` flow floor used for Eys evidence and supplemental exact-pool lookup |
| `gmgn_pool_resolution_max_mints` | `12` | Maximum fresh flow-qualified GMGN mints resolved through Datapi per scan; Eys `1m` intake also uses bounded market-cap slices including `$1M–$2M`; failed/malformed lookups are omitted |
| `min_pool_fees_usd` | `1700` | Eys fee floor: ≥10 SOL/day in pool fees (~$1,700) |
| `min_fee_vol_ratio` | `0.0005` | Eys fake-volume check: minimum 24h fees ÷ 24h volume (rejects `fee_vol_ratio_below_min`). At p01 of fee-floor passers, trims only the degenerate tail; `vol24h = 0` skips the check — unknown is never treated as fake |
| `min_pool_vol_30m_usd` | `5000` | Eys pool-volume floor (rejects `pool_vol_below_floor`). Self-consistency with the P2 rotation exit, which leaves a meme position once pool `vol30m` drops under `rotation_vol_30m_min_usd`: an entry already under that floor is born exit-eligible and churns out minutes later having paid rent plus transaction fees for nothing. Keep equal to `[manage] rotation_vol_30m_min_usd` |

## `[discovery]` — optional exact-pool event intake

This source is **off by default** and supplements, rather than replaces, the ranked Meteora Datapi sweep. When enabled it polls the configured Solana RPC (Helius recommended), paginates a bounded signature window for the Meteora DLMM program, persists a restart-safe signature queue, decodes published pool-initialization instructions, resolves exact `lbPair` addresses through Datapi, and enriches event mints through GMGN direct `token info` for a genuine `1m` flow row. Window truncation, backlog caps, and unavailable parsed transactions are surfaced in telemetry; they do not authorize entries.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `event_intake_enabled` | `false` | Enable the supplemental Meteora event source |
| `max_signatures_per_poll` | `25` | RPC signatures per page; aligned with the transaction parse budget |
| `max_signature_pages_per_poll` | `1` | Maximum page per scan; a full bound is reported as `windowTruncated` and retained as backfill |
| `max_transactions_per_poll` | `25` | Maximum pending signatures parsed per scan; newest pending work is prioritized while a bounded oldest slice drains |
| `max_transaction_retries` | `3` | Null parsed transactions are retried this many times before `unavailable` |
| `max_pending_signatures` | `1000` | Maximum pending signatures retained; the head cursor pauses when full |
| `max_backfill_ranges` | `8` | Maximum active pagination gaps retained; new head advancement pauses when full |
| `event_ttl_s` | `21600` | How long decoded events remain eligible for exact-pool resolution |
| `max_event_pools` | `25` | Maximum recent event pools considered per scan |
| `pool_fetch_concurrency` | `4` | Concurrent Datapi lookups for exact event pools |

## `[gates]` — pool hard gates

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `tvl_min_usd` | `5000` | Minimum pool TVL |
| `tvl_max_usd` | `2000000` | Maximum pool TVL (above: fees too diluted) |
| `mcap_min_usd` | `100000` | Hard market-cap floor |
| `mcap_micro_max_usd` | `200000` | $100–200k mcap routes to the micro sleeve |
| `mcap_micro_score_min` | `75` | Micro needs a higher score than the normal 60 floor |
| `min_entry_score` | `60` | Skip any entry whose final score is below this (`score_min`). 60 = the sizing floor, so no change until raised |
| `micro_tvl_min_usd` | `15000` | Stricter TVL floor for micro only |
| `micro_max_pool_share_pct` | `10` | Micro position may not exceed this % of pool TVL |
| `micro_size_mult` | `0.5` | Micro sizes at half the core Kelly size |
| `micro_max_position_sol` | `0.45` | Absolute micro position cap |
| `micro_max_slots` | `1` | At most one micro position at a time |
| `micro_deploy_cap_pct` | `5` | Max % of wallet in open micro positions |
| `fee_tvl_24h_min_pct` | `20` | Min 24h fee/TVL, %/day |
| `fee_tvl_30m_daily_min_pct` | `10` | Min 30m fee/TVL annualized to daily, %/day |
| `vol_30m_min_usd` | `25000` | Min 30-minute volume |
| `vol_trend_min` | `0.8` | `vol_1h / (vol_24h/24)` floor — not in freefall |
| `base_fee_min_pct` / `base_fee_max_pct` | `0.2` / `5.0` | Base-fee band; >5% pools are arb-only |
| `bin_step_min_new` | `80` | Min bin step for tokens < 7 days old |
| `fee_collection` | `"prefer_quote"` | `prefer_quote` (bonus for SOL-only fee pools), `quote_only`, `both_only`, or `any` |
| `quote_mints` | SOL mint | Allowed quote tokens (SOL only in meme mode) |
| `price_divergence_max_pct` | `2.0` | Max pool price vs Jupiter quote divergence |
| `max_pool_share_pct` | `20` | Skip if our position would exceed this % of pool TVL |

## `[vetting]` — token hard gates

Master switches (also in Settings UI) — off skips that hard fail; thresholds apply when on:

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `age_min_enabled` | `true` | Block "too young" (mint age via RugCheck, not pool age) |
| `age_max_enabled` | `false` | Block "too old". Off by default — the fee/volume gates already test current traction, so a revived old meme with live volume is a valid pool. A *fit* gate, not a safety one. |
| `insider_gate_enabled` | `true` | Block high insider / funding-cluster % |
| `holder_gate_enabled` | `true` | Block single-holder / top-10 concentration |
| `rugcheck_veto_enabled` | `true` | Block high RugCheck score (the rugged-creator flag stays on regardless) |
| `creator_rug_enabled` | `true` | Block creators with prior rugs |
| `gmgn_security_enabled` | `true` | Block honeypot / buy-tax / sell-tax flags from GMGN (buy tax ≥0% = confirmed dev fee, Eys "0 developer fees") |

Thresholds:

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `single_holder_max_pct` | `15` | Max % of supply for any single holder |
| `top10_max_pct` | `40` | Max % for top-10 holders combined |
| `insider_cluster_max_pct` | `10` | Max % held by insider/funding clusters |
| `rugcheck_veto_normalised` | `41` | RugCheck "Danger" veto line |
| `age_min_minutes` | `45` | Survive the instant-rug window |
| `age_max_days` | `14` | Meme-mode age ceiling — only applies when `age_max_enabled = true` |
| `allow_token2022_extensions` | `["metadata"]` | Token-2022 extensions tolerated (nothing else) |

## `[timing]` — soft, feeds the score

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `freefall_15m_max_pct` | `-20` | 15m return below this = penalty |
| `ath_proximity_pct` | `3` | Within this % of ATH + overextension = penalty |
| `vol_spike_ratio` | `3` | Last 5m candle ≥ 3× trailing-hour average = ignition |
| `vol_spike_bonus` | `0.25` | Score bonus for ignition |

## `[score_caps]`, `[smartflow]`, `[score]`

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `score_caps.bonus_cap_total` | `10` | Trending + smart-flow bonuses combined never exceed this |
| `smartflow.window_min` | `30` | Rolling window (minutes) for GMGN smart-money feeds |
| `smartflow.min_wallets` / `bonus_wallets` | `3` / `4` | ≥3 distinct smart wallets buying → +4 |
| `smartflow.min_joiners` / `bonus_joiners` | `2` / `4` | ≥2 newly-joining wallets → +4 |
| `smartflow.bonus_kol` | `4` | Any KOL buy in window → +4 |
| `smartflow.net_sell_penalty_usd` / `penalty_net_sell` | `5000` / `8` | Net smart-money selling beyond $5k → −8 |
| `score.w_fee_momentum` | `30` | Score weight: fee/TVL momentum |
| `score.w_turnover` | `20` | Score weight: volume/TVL turnover |
| `score.w_vetting_soft` | `25` | Score weight: soft vetting quality |
| `score.w_timing` | `15` | Score weight: timing filter |
| `score.w_pool_structure` | `10` | Score weight: bin step / fee tier fit (weights sum to 100) |

## `[entry]`

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `fib_bottom` | `0.786` | Fib retracement anchoring the range bottom |
| `max_down_pct` | `50` | Max range depth below price (was 65; deepest bins sat below where P0 fires) |
| `min_down_pct` | `40` | Minimum depth — never a thin sliver |
| `max_quote_drift_bins` | `3` | Re-quote the pool just before planning the range; skip the entry if it moved more than this many bins since the scan. `0` disables |
| `max_position_accounts` | `2` | Max DLMM position accounts per entry (69 bins each) |
| `bin_rent_budget_sol` | `0.075` | Soft rent budget (one bin array) — shrink range first |
| `bin_rent_hard_sol` | `0.15` | Hard budget (two arrays), only when score qualifies |
| `bin_rent_hard_score_min` | `80` | Score needed for the two-array budget |
| `bin_rent_max_pos_pct` | `25` | Rent is non-refundable, so it may not exceed this % of the position either. Identical to the soft budget at a 0.3 SOL entry; only binds on smaller ones. `0` = no cap |
| `liquidity_slippage_pct` | `5.0` | Active-bin slippage at open (≈5 bins at step 100; 1% caused 100% of live open failures) |
| `tranche_enabled` | `true` | Second, deeper BidAsk pocket for top scores |
| `tranche_score_min` | `85` | Score needed for a tranche |
| `tranche_size_pct` | `50` | Tranche size as % of primary |
| `tranche_max_down_pct` | `70` | Tranche target depth (clamped by the P0 safety margin to ~50%) |

## `[manage]` — the P0–P5 state machine

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `poll_s` | `20` | Seconds between position polls. Every open position costs one RPC read-set per poll, so this is the main dial on RPC spend; it also sets the wall-clock length of every knob counted in polls (`stop_loss_sustain_polls`, `rotation_polls`, `follow.cold_polls_end`) |
| `mark_concurrency` | `4` | How many **pools** may be marked at once per tick. Marking used to be strictly serial, so a tick cost the sum of every position's RPC latency and mean mark gaps ran past `poll_s`. Same calls and same rate-limit budget — they just stop queueing behind each other. Positions in the same pool always mark one at a time; `1` restores the old serial behaviour |
| `safety_tvl_drop_pct` | `40` | P0: pool TVL drop in 10 min |
| `tvl_drain_min_tvl_usd` | `20000` | Skip `tvl_drain` when the pool's median TVL over the window is below this — a thin pool's TVL is a handful of LPs and swings 40–50% on ordinary repositioning (measured: same token, same 4 min, $8k pool −51% vs $67k pool −9%). `pool_dead` / `price_crash` still cover a real collapse |
| `tvl_drain_min_pool_age_min` | `20` | Skip `tvl_drain` on a pool younger than this — the 10-min median of a newborn pool is its own birth. Unknown age does not suppress |
| `tvl_drain_price_rise_veto_pct` | `25` | Suppress a `tvl_drain` exit when price rose ≥ this % over the same 10-min window — the pool is being **traded through** (ask-side inventory bought out), not drained. Price is the tie-breaker, not volume: a rug prints heavy volume too. `0` disables |
| `tvl_drain_cooldown_h` | `1` | Token cooldown after a `tvl_drain` exit (6h until v0.17.1: across 12 drain exits none was a rug and half were above the exit price an hour later). That trigger is a **liquidity** condition — a thin pool being traded through looks identical to a rug — so it no longer permanently bans the token and its creator. Rug-evidence triggers (`pool_dead`, `price_crash`, `rugcheck_flip`, holder/insider) keep the permanent one-strike ban |
| `safety_wallet_dump_pct` | `3` | P0: single holder's supply-% drop between polls |
| `safety_new_whale_pct` | `10` | P0: new wallet exceeding this % of supply |
| `holder_poll_s` | `90` | Holder-snapshot interval per open position |
| `safety_price_crash_pct` | `-60` | P0: price vs entry, **at any age** — deliberately no time window |
| `stop_loss_frac` | `0.75` | P1: close when SOL value < entry × this |
| `stop_loss_sustain_polls` | `4` | While **below range**, P1 must be under the stop for this many consecutive polls (~60s) before firing — wick tolerance. In range the stop is immediate. A violent collapse is still caught instantly by P0 `price_crash` |
| `stop_loss_count_claimed_fees` | `false` | Count fees **already claimed** (realized SOL in the wallet) in the value P1 compares to entry. Off = MTM only. Either way the bot logs a `P1_fee_offset_deferred` decision whenever the two settings would disagree, so leave it off for a week and read the Funnel before turning it on. A real crash fires identically under both |
| `loss_reentry_cooldown_h` | `24` | Cooldown after a loss exit |
| `give_back_enabled` | `true` | Give-back stop, meme sleeves only: once a position has been up past min(0.02 SOL, 5% of entry) fee-inclusive, close when PnL hands back to `give_back_keep_frac` of that peak. Exits as `give_back`; the token is benched 15 min like an escape. Promoted from a month of telemetry (replay +2.657 SOL / 120 closes; live triggers +0.857 SOL / 20) |
| `give_back_keep_frac` | `0.75` | Fraction of the peak PnL the position must keep; below it the give-back stop fires. Replay was flat across 0.75–0.95 |
| `rotation_fee_daily_min_pct` | `5` | P2: fee-rate floor, %/day |
| `rotation_polls` | `3` | P2: consecutive polls under the floor before rotating |
| `rotation_vol_30m_min_usd` | `5000` | P2: 30m volume floor |
| `max_age_h` | `48` | P2: forced re-evaluation age |
| `above_range_pct` | `5` | P3: how far above range top counts as "above" |
| `above_range_sustain_min` | `10` | P3 wins exit after 10 min (short so follow can arm) |
| `above_range_missed_sustain_min` | `45` | P3 misses wait 45 min (10 min was churning rent) |
| `rebalance_max_per_6h` | `2` | Re-entry/rebalance rate limit |
| `rebalance_cost_max_pct_of_fees` | `25` | Skip if rent+tx would exceed this % of fees earned |
| `reentry_ladder_mult` | `0.75` | Each re-entry sizes at this × the previous |
| `reentry_max_per_24h` | `2` | Max re-entries per token per 24h |
| `house_money_rule` | `false` | Off: it banked notional profit with no release path |
| `claim_min_sol` | `0.05` | P4: claim when unclaimed fees reach this |
| `claim_min_txcost_mult` | `20` | …or ≥ 20× estimated tx cost |
| `claim_interval_h` | `4` | …or every 4h regardless |
| `grace_claim_min_sol` | `0.005` | Claim floor when price first drops below range (bank fees at the top of a dump) |
| `fee_destination` | `"bank"` | `bank` (swap fees to SOL, wallet) — `compound`/`hybrid` reserved |
| `compound_score_min` | `70` | Min pool score for compounding (if ever enabled) |
| `escape_hatch_depth_pct` | `60` | Escape hatch: dip through this % of range depth… |
| `escape_hatch_recovery_pct` | `25` | …then recovery into the top % of range → close & reset |
| `max_position_accounts` | `2` | Bin-account ceiling (69 bins each). A pool too fine-stepped to fit `min_down_pct` is skipped as `range_too_shallow` |
| `escape_hatch_absolute` | `true` | Use absolute drawdown from entry (arm at −26.4%, recover at −12%) instead of a fraction of range depth. On since 2026-09-05 as the range-width test's prerequisite; see RANGE-WIDTH-DECISION.md |
| `escape_hatch_drawdown_pct` | `26.4` | Absolute form: arm once price is this % below entry |
| `escape_hatch_recovery_drawdown_pct` | `12.0` | Absolute form: …then recovery to within this % of entry → close & reset |
| `escape_reentry_cooldown_min` | `15` | Bench the token this long after an escape close before re-entering it (0 = off) |
| `profit_lock_enabled` | `true` | Bank a slice of strong runners |
| `profit_lock_at_frac` | `1.30` | Fires at mark ≥ entry × 1.30 while in range |
| `profit_lock_withdraw_pct` | `30` | Withdraw this % of liquidity |
| `profit_lock_max_fires` | `1` | At most once per position |
| `below_range_grace_min` | `15` | P5: wick-tolerance grace before closing |

## `[sizing]` — Kelly / Fixed & portfolio limits

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `mode` | `"kelly"` | `"kelly"` (ledger) or `"fixed"` (per-sleeve SOL / % of deployable) |
| `max_positions` | `5` | Max concurrent positions (tranches count) |
| `min_position_sol` | `0.3` | **Ceiling** on the position floor — the floor itself scales with your wallet (Fixed skips instead of bumping) |
| `min_position_pct` | `1.0` | Floor as a % of equity. Effective floor = `max(min_position_floor_sol, min(min_position_sol, equity × this))`. `0` = flat floor |
| `min_position_floor_sol` | `0.05` | Hard economic floor — below it, fees can't beat tx+rent overhead at any bankroll |
| `min_reentry_sol` | `0.2` | Separate viability floor for re-entries (reused accounts are cheaper); also capped by the scaled floor |
| `kelly_enabled` | `true` | Mirror of `mode=="kelly"` (compat for older profiles) |
| `kelly_fraction` | `0.25` | Quarter-Kelly (half-Kelly assumes a *proven* edge) |
| `kelly_lookback` | `100` | Closed positions in the rolling estimate |
| `kelly_min_samples` | `25` | Below this, cold start applies |
| `kelly_cold_start_frac` | `0.03` | Cold start: flat 3% of wallet per position |
| `kelly_max_position_frac` | `0.10` | Hard cap: no position exceeds 10% of wallet (Kelly and Fixed) |
| `kelly_block_negative` | `false` | Off: negative edge clamps to the min-size floor instead of a permanent stop |
| `kelly_core_unit` / `_sol` / `_pct` / `_mult` | `pct` / `0.5` / `4` / `1.0` | Core meme base when `mode=kelly`. Default is a flat 4% of deployable since 2026-09-05 (SIZING-MODE-DECISION.md Gate 3: the adaptive Kelly base sat at the floor for a week after three bad closes); set `kelly` for the adaptive base |
| `kelly_micro_unit` / `_sol` / `_pct` / `_mult` | `kelly` / `0.3` / `3` / `1.0` | Micro sleeve when `mode=kelly` |
| `kelly_majors_unit` / `_sol` / `_pct` / `_mult` | `sol` / `0.75` / `10` / `1.0` | Majors when `mode=kelly` |
| `kelly_follow_unit` / `_sol` / `_pct` / `_mult` | `sol` / `0.25` / `2` / `1.0` | Follow legs when `mode=kelly` |
| `fixed_core_unit` / `_sol` / `_pct` | `sol` / `0.5` / `5` | Core meme size when `mode=fixed` |
| `fixed_micro_unit` / `_sol` / `_pct` | `sol` / `0.3` / `3` | Micro sleeve when `mode=fixed` |
| `fixed_majors_unit` / `_sol` / `_pct` | `sol` / `0.75` / `10` | Majors when `mode=fixed` |
| `fixed_follow_unit` / `_sol` / `_pct` | `sol` / `0.25` / `2` | Follow legs when `mode=fixed` |
| `reserve_sol` | `1.0` | Operational reserve, never deployed |
| `reserve_max_pct` | `25` | Caps the flat `reserve_sol` at this % of equity, so a small wallet still has a bankroll (no effect at or above 4 SOL) |
| `reserve_pct` | `10` | Plus this % of bankroll held back for rent/fees |
| `per_token_max_pct` | `40` | Max % of deployable in one token incl. tranche |
| `score_mult_low` / `mid` / `high` | `0.5` / `1.0` / `1.5` | Size tilt for score 60–70 / 70–85 / 85+ (Kelly only) |
| `circuit_daily_loss_pct` | `3` | Circuit breaker: realized 24h loss % of bankroll pauses new entries (open positions still managed). `0` disables the breaker |
| `circuit_pause_h` | `12` | Breaker pause length |
| `circuit_weekly_triggers_halt` | `2` | Two trips in 7 days → full halt until resumed |
| `cluster_brake_exits` | `4` | Cluster brake: this many lossy hard exits… |
| `cluster_brake_window_h` | `6` | …within this window… |
| `cluster_brake_pause_h` | `2` | …pauses new entries this long |
| `cluster_brake_loss_pct` | `10` | "Lossy" = realized ≤ −10% of entry |
| `regime_filter` | `true` | SOL/USD regime filter on |
| `regime_sol_24h_halve_pct` | `-8` | SOL −8%/24h → halve new sizes |
| `regime_sol_24h_pause_pct` | `-15` | SOL −15%/24h → pause new entries |

## `[follow]` — up-only re-entry chains

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `true` | Follow mode on |
| `min_vol_30m_usd` | `100000` | Required to **arm** a chain (checked at close time) and to **fire** a leg — 4× the normal entry volume floor. Before v0.12.0 only firing was gated, so chains armed on quiet pools and held the token lock for hours |
| `retrace_arm_pct` | `15` | Required dip from the post-exit / post-high peak |
| `range_depth_pct` | `30` | Leg depth (tighter than the 40% default) |
| `leg_size_sol` | `0.25` | Fixed leg size — the mode earns more with its own ledger |
| `max_legs` | `3` | Per chain |
| `chain_loss_budget_sol` | `0.1` | Chain ends when cumulative leg PnL breaches this |
| `chain_max_age_h` | `12` | Chain lifetime |
| `cold_polls_end` | `3` | Consecutive polls under the normal volume floor ends the chain |
| `open_fail_cooldown_s` | `300` | Wait after a failed leg open |
| `awaiting_dip_max_min` | `90` | A chain waiting this long for its retrace ends and releases the token. Measured from when it last entered the dip-wait, not from chain start. Every leg that ever fired did so within 52 min. `0` = never |

## `[majors]` — spot parking for allowlisted alts

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` / `discovery` | `false` / `true` | Sleeve off by default since 2026-09-05 (43 live closes, +0.04 SOL on 837 SOL-hours); open majors positions still manage out. `true` re-enables; discovery sweep runs only when enabled |
| `discovery_pages` | `8` | Datapi pages for the majors sweep |
| `symbol_allowlist` | `PUMP, JTO, BONK, WIF, RAY, JUP` | Only these symbols (ANSEM removed 2026-08-20 — it carried ~92% of majors losses on both live bots) |
| `mcap_min_usd` | `0` | No mcap floor (allowlist is the gate) |
| `age_min_days` | `7` | Token must be ≥ 7 days old |
| `strategy_shape` | `"spot"` | Uniform bins — not the meme BidAsk ramp |
| `range_below_pct` | `12` | Range depth below the active bin. The top is always the active bin — a SOL-only deposit cannot fund bins above price, so `range_above_pct` is ignored since v0.15.0 (kept so old configs still parse) |
| `entry_rsi_period` / `entry_rsi_max` | `14` / `45` | Enter when RSI ≤ 45 (oversold)… |
| `entry_swing_position_max` | `0.40` | …or price in the bottom 40% of the 24h swing |
| `entry_swing_avoid_top` | `0.75` | Never enter above 75% of the swing range |
| `fee_tvl_24h_min_pct` / `fee_tvl_30m_daily_min_pct` | `0.08` / `0.05` | Much lower heat floors than meme |
| `tvl_min_usd` / `tvl_max_usd` | `100000` / `10000000` | TVL band |
| `vol_30m_min_usd` | `15000` | Volume floor (was 5000; sub-15k entries only ever churned P2 rotations) |
| `max_pool_share_pct` | `5` | Pool-share cap |
| `size_sol` / `max_position_sol` | `0.75` / `1.5` | Fixed entry size / absolute cap |
| `max_slots` | `1` | One majors position at a time |
| `deploy_cap_pct` | `40` | Max % of wallet in majors |
| `meme_reserve_slots` | `2` | Majors only enter when this many slots stay free for memes |
| `stop_loss_frac` | `0.60` | Wider stop than meme (spot holds inventory) |
| `escape_hatch_enabled` | `false` | Majors hold through dips |
| `below_range_grace_min` | `120` | 2h grace below range (vs meme 15m) |
| `claim_min_sol` | `0.02` | Claim floor |
| `fee_compound` | `false` | Bank only |
| `profit_lock_enabled` | `false` | Off for majors |
| `max_age_h` | `168` | One-week age cap |
| `above_range_sustain_min` / `above_range_missed_sustain_min` | `240` / `480` | Slow take-profit timers |
| `rotation_fee_daily_min_pct` | `0.05` | Rotation floor (must sit at/below the entry floor) |
| `rotation_vol_30m_min_usd` | `2000` | Rotation volume floor |
| `rotation_polls` | `20` | Sustained decay before rotating |
| `[[majors.pools]]` | PUMP seed | Optional whitelist seeds; discovery still finds the best live pool per symbol |

## `[rotation]` — capital agility

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `alpha_slots` | `1` | Slots reserved for score ≥ `alpha_score_min` only |
| `alpha_score_min` | `85` | The alpha bar |
| `displacement_enabled` | `true` | Full book + exceptional candidate → close weakest |
| `displacement_margin` | `15` | Candidate must beat the weakest's *current* score by this |
| `displacement_min_hold_min` | `30` | Positions younger than this are safe |
| `displacement_value_frac_min` | `0.97` | Never displace a position > 3% underwater |
| `displacement_max_per_6h` | `2` | Displacement rate limit |

## `[exec]`

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `mode` | `paper` \| `live` | Live **also** requires `FARMER_MODE=live` in the environment — both switches or nothing trades |
| `exit_slippage_bps` | `50` | Normal exit swap slippage |
| `safety_exit_slippage_bps` | `1000` | P0 safety exits: speed over price |
| `tx_retries` | `3` | Network retries before abandoning and re-quoting |
| `priority_fee_percentile` | `75` | Percentile of the **nonzero** recent fees on the accounts the tx writes. The zero-fee majority says nothing about the cost to compete |
| `priority_fee_floor_microlamports` | `10000` | Never bid below this (≈0.000002 SOL at a 200k CU limit) |
| `priority_fee_cap_microlamports` | `1000000` | Never bid above this (≈0.0002 SOL at a 200k CU limit). Raise on a congested day |
| `priority_fee_retry_mult` | `1.5` | Fee is multiplied by this per retry attempt. `1.0` disables escalation |
| `compute_unit_margin_pct` | `20` | Headroom over simulated consumption when we set the CU limit |
| `compute_unit_fallback` | `600000` | CU limit when simulation fails. Applies only to transactions **we** build — the DLMM SDK sets its own |

::: tip Why both halves matter
A prioritization fee is `price × requested compute-unit limit`, and you're charged on what the transaction *asks for*, not what it burns. Leaving the limit unset means paying for the implicit 200k-per-instruction default — and, worse, under-reserving a multi-hop swap route so it fails on compute exhaustion. The DLMM SDK simulates and sets its own limit; for the zap swap and the small hand-built transactions the bot now simulates and sets one too.
:::
| `paper_promotion_days` | `7` | Consecutive profitable paper days for live eligibility |

<p class="note ok">The 1% GNME buy-and-burn fee is hardcoded in <code>src/executor/profitBurn.ts</code> — not a config key. See <a href="./fees">Fees</a>.</p>

## `[watchdog]`

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `rpc_blind_after_min` | `5` | After this long without a successful mark: **alert and freeze new entries** — never liquidate blind. (The old blind close-all was *removed from the code* in 2026‑08, not just disabled.) |

## `[gmgn]`

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `true` | Auto-off when `GMGN_API_KEY` is empty |
| `intervals` | `["5m", "1h"]` | Trending windows checked each scan |
| `min_liquidity_usd` | `10000` | Liquidity floor for trending entries |
| `bonus_sustained` / `bonus_emerging` / `bonus_fading` | `8` / `4` / `3` | Score bonus: trending in both windows / 5m only / 1h only |
| `require_renounced` | `true` | Trending entry says mint/freeze not renounced → pre-vet skip |

GMGN calls are optional enrichment. The bot serializes `gmgn-cli` (one in flight), paces ~1 req/s with route weights, and parks ~5 minutes on HTTP 429 (or until `reset_at`) — see [API keys → GMGN](./api-keys#gmgn-api-key-gmgn_api_key-optional).

## `[apis]`

| Key | Default |
|---|---|
| `meteora_datapi` | `https://dlmm.datapi.meteora.ag` |
| `rugcheck` | `https://api.rugcheck.xyz` |
| `jupiter_quote` | `https://lite-api.jup.ag/swap/v1` |
| `jupiter_price` | `https://lite-api.jup.ag/price/v3` |
| `jup_datapi` | `https://datapi.jup.ag` (undocumented; soft signals only) |
| `geckoterminal` | `https://api.geckoterminal.com/api/v2` — deep candles (100 bars/call, keyless, SOL-denominated via `currency=token`) |

## `[candles]`

The Meteora datapi caps `/ohlcv` at **10 bars on every timeframe**, which silently starved every candle reader: majors RSI(14) was never computable, the meme timing filter's "last hour" was 50 minutes, and the planner's "24h swing" was the last 10 bars. GeckoTerminal is now the primary source with the datapi as fallback — you never get fewer bars than before.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `deep_source_enabled` | `true` | Use GeckoTerminal for candles; `false` = datapi only (10 bars) |
| `limit` | `100` | Bars per fetch. RSI(14) needs 15+; swing/ATH checks want as many as possible |
| `max_per_min` | `25` | Rate cap (GeckoTerminal public limit is 30/min). Results are cached 60s so one fetch serves a whole tick |

## Environment variables (`.env` / `data/.env`)

Not in `config.toml`, but part of the same picture:

| Var | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `FARMER_MODE` | `paper` (default) or `live` — half of the live double lock |
| `RPC_URL` | Solana RPC endpoint — we suggest [Helius](https://www.helius.dev/) mainnet (`https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=…`) |
| `JUPITER_API_KEY` | [Jupiter Developer Portal](https://developers.jup.ag/portal) API key for exit swaps (free tier OK) |
| `GMGN_API_KEY` | Optional — [GMGN](https://gmgn.ai/ai) query key for trending/vetting enrichment. See [API keys](./api-keys#gmgn-api-key-gmgn_api_key-optional) |
| `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` / `WALLET_KEYPAIR_PATH` | Live wallet (or use the dashboard's encrypted wallet instead) |
| `WALLET_PASSPHRASE` | Optional (Railway): auto-unlock the encrypted wallet on boot |
| `DASH_TOKEN` / `DASH_PORT` | Dashboard auth token and port (default 8787) |
| `FARMER_CONFIG_PATH` / `FARMER_ENV_PATH` / `FARMER_DB_PATH` | Override runtime file locations (PM2 ecosystem sets these under `data/`) |
