Local pacing mirrors GMGN’s published limits but cannot see the server’s remaining tokens — another bot on the same key (or a drained bucket after restart) can still 429. Holders/traders cost 5×; trader tags off by default. A real `RATE_LIMIT_*` **parks all GMGN until reset** — queued work is dropped (retries extend the ban), and the cooldown is written to `data/gmgn-pace.json` so a restart or deploy still honours it. Each ban also **tightens the local budget one step** (36 → 25 → 18 → 13 → 9 calls/min, with proportionally wider gaps) and a clean 15 min relaxes it one step, so pacing converges instead of re-earning the same ban.

Two of the twelve best trades entered during a shut-off and got the minimum size instead. Worth knowing what this rule does and does not do: sizing up and down with the book has never beaten a flat fraction on this ledger — at any window length tested — because trade outcomes here don't run in streaks, so cutting size after losses just means being small when the next winner shows up. The window change removes the worst of that; it does not make the rule predictive. Fixed sizing remains a supported alternative under Sizing mode. You may notice a sizing_flat_deferred row in the skip funnel: that is not a skipped trade. On every core entry the bot records what a flat size would have been next to the size it actually used, so the question can be settled on real data later.
