/**
 * Candle history for a pool, deep enough for the indicators that read it.
 *
 * The Meteora datapi caps `/ohlcv` at 10 bars on every timeframe — verified
 * 2026-08-15 across 5m/30m/1h/4h with every paging parameter it might accept.
 * That silently starved every consumer:
 *   - majors RSI(14): never computable → `rsi ?` on every log line, and the
 *     timing gate has been swing-only since it was written;
 *   - meme timingPart: "last hour" = slice(-12) got 10, its trailing-hour
 *     volume average got 9;
 *   - planner.swing(): "24h lookback of 5m candles" (288 bars) got 10, so
 *     "swing high/low" and the ATH-proximity check were the last 50 minutes.
 * None of it errored — each degrades gracefully — which is why it lasted.
 *
 * GeckoTerminal serves 100 bars per call, free and keyless, keyed by the same
 * pool address, and covers pools minutes old. Its public limit is 30 req/min,
 * so this module rate-limits and caches: three call sites (scan, meme entry,
 * majors entry) at up to a few pools each per 60s tick fit comfortably, and a
 * 60s cache means one fetch serves the whole tick. On any failure or when the
 * source is disabled, the datapi's 10 bars come back — never fewer than before.
