 * The setting has been offered in the dashboard as "used if the primary RPC
 * fails" since it was added, but nothing read `env().rpcUrlFallback` — every
 * call site built its own `new Connection(env().rpcUrl)`, so a primary outage
 * took the bot down with a backup node configured and idle. That includes the
 * live boot path, where the failure mode is the bot refusing to start while
 * positions sit on chain.
 *
 * Failover is per-request, not per-process: each request tries the primary,
 * and on a connect-level throw or a retryable status tries the fallback once.
 * There is no stickiness — a primary that recovers is used again immediately,
 * and a fallback that is only needed for one request costs one extra call.
 *
 * Re-sending a transaction to a second node is safe: Solana dedupes by
 * signature, so the worst case is the same signed transaction reaching the
 * cluster twice, which is what any rebroadcast does anyway.
