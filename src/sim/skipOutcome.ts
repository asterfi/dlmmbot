/**
 * What a token did AFTER the scanner rejected it.
 *
 * `decisions.outcome_backfill_json` was declared in the initial schema with the
 * comment "filled later: what the token did after" and then never written — 0
 * of 218,328 rows on the live book. Without it, judging a gate means asking
 * whether the tokens it blocked would have paid, and the only answer available
 * is "the rows are gone". This fills the column.
 *
 * Two things make the naive version useless:
 *
 *  1. VOLUME. 93% of skip rows were one gate (`fee_tvl_24h`, 203k rows) logged
 *     once per pool per sweep. Backfilling per row would be ~200k API calls to
 *     re-fetch the same handful of price paths. We collapse to EPISODES —
 *     one (mint, pool, gate) per `EPISODE_BUCKET_S` — and anchor on the first
 *     sweep of each. A token blocked for six straight hours is one fetch.
 *     Since 2026-09-25 `recordSkip` stores rows as episodes already, carrying
 *     the sweep count in `sweeps`; the GROUP BY below still folds the per-sweep
 *     rows written before that.
 *
 *  2. EVICTION. Skip rows are pruned, and the size ceiling has been evicting
 *     them at ~30 hours on the live book, far inside the 30-day age window. A
 *     result written here would be deleted before anyone read it, so
 *     `pruneHistory` now spares rows that carry one (db.ts).
 *
 * We store the raw path — peak, trough, close, how much of it traded below the
 * skip price — and NOT verdicts like "would have hit P0". Thresholds move;
 * measurements should not have to be re-fetched when they do.
